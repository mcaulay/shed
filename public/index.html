You can find issues/versions/explosions/volumes of them around Aberdeen but
your best bet would be to try <a href="http://www.offset57.co.uk/" title="Offset57">offset57</a>.
It is haphazardly, unpredidictabily and mostly lethargically made by Stewart
Ainslie and Mark McAulay. Two battle hardened memebers of the Aberdeen
creative industry who really should know better but hey, what are you going
to do eh?
If you <em>really</em> want one and cant find one anywhere or if you want us to
interview you for a future Shed,
<a href="https://twitter.com/shedpeople">go right ahead and ask us on twitter</a>.</p>
