    Shed is a side project about your side projects.
    You can find issues/versions/explosions/volumes of them around Aberdeen but
    your best bet would be to try [offset57](http://www.offset57.co.uk/ "Offset57").
    It is haphazardly, unpredidictabily and mostly lethargically made by Stewart
    Ainslie and Mark McAulay. Two battle hardened memebers of the Aberdeen
    creative industry who really should know better but hey, what are you going
    to do eh?
    If you _really_ want one and cant find one anywhere or if you want us to
    interview you for a future Shed,
    [go right ahead and ask us on twitter](https://twitter.com/shedpeople).

  | â€º steal whatever you think you can get away with but fair warning, we will give you unending abuse if we find out.
